THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This aims to monitor the safety of vulnerable road users, particularly cyclists, by developing a black box system that collects and analyzes data on user conditions, environmental factors, and vehicle surroundings.
Initially using Raspberry Pi, the system evolved to a more reliable architecture featuring the **Portenta H7 microcontroller**, **Nicla Sense Me environmental sensors**, **Lidar Sensor**, and **GNSS**, all integrated with **ISD Card** to log all the data.
Recent tests showed **improved responsiveness**, faster **GNSS fixes**, and reliable data logging, although further refinements are needed to stabilize **air quality readings** and optimize **power efficiency** for extended use.
